    <p>We’ll begin with a box, and the plural is boxes,<br>
        But the plural of ox becomes oxen, not oxes.br <br>
        One fowl is a goose, but two are called geese,<br>
        Yet the plural of moose should never be meese.br<br>
        You may find a lone mouse or a nest full of mice,<br>
        Yet the plural of house is houses, not hice.</p>
       <font size =2 <p><u>If</u> the plural of man is always called men,<br>
            Why shouldn’t the plural of pan be called pen?<br>
            <u>If</u> I speak of my foot and show you my feet,<br>
            And I give you a boot, would a pair be called beet?<br>
           <u>If</u> one is a tooth and a whole set are teeth,<br>
            Why shouldn’t the plural of booth be called beeth?</p> </font>
            <font size = 1 <p>Then one may be that, and three would be those,<br>
                Yet hat in the plural would never be hose,<br>
                And the plural of cat is cats, not cose.<br>
                We speak of a brother and also of brethren,<br>
                But though we say mother, we never say methren.<br>
                Then the masculine pronouns are he, his and him,<br>
                <s>But imagine the feminine: she, shis and shim!</s></p>
